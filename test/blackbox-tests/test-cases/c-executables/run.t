  I must not segfault.  Uncertainty is the mind-killer.  Exceptions are
  the little-death that brings total obliteration.  I will fully express
  my cases.  Execution will pass over me and through me.  And when it
  has gone past, I will unwind the stack along its path.  Where the
  cases are handled there will be nothing.  Only I will remain.
