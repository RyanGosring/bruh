Showcase that using same library name in two workspaces is possible for private libraries

  $ mkdir -p a b
  $ cat > dune-project << EOF
  > (lang dune 3.13)
  > (package (name bar) (allow_empty))
  > (package (name baz) (allow_empty))
  > EOF

  $ cat > dune-workspace << EOF
  > (lang dune 3.13)
  > 
  > (context default)
  > 
  > (context
  >  (default
  >   (name alt-context)))
  > EOF
  $ cat > a/dune << EOF
  > (library
  >  (name foo)
  >  (enabled_if (= %{context_name} "default")))
  > EOF
  $ cat > a/foo.ml <<EOF
  > let x = "foo"
  > EOF

  $ cat > b/dune << EOF
  > (library
  >  (name foo)
  >  (enabled_if (= %{context_name} "alt-context")))
  > EOF
  $ cat > b/foo.ml <<EOF
  > let x = "foo"
  > EOF

  $ dune build

But not for public libraries

  $ cat > a/dune << EOF
  > (library
  >  (name foo)
  >  (public_name bar.foo)
  >  (enabled_if (= %{context_name} "default")))
  > EOF

  $ cat > b/dune << EOF
  > (library
  >  (name foo)
  >  (public_name baz.foo)
  >  (enabled_if (= %{context_name} "alt-context")))
  > EOF

  $ dune build
  Error: Library foo is defined twice:
  - b/dune:3
  - a/dune:3

In the same context

  $ cat > a/dune << EOF
  > (library
  >  (name foo))
  > EOF

  $ cat > b/dune << EOF
  > (library
  >  (name foo))
  > EOF

  $ dune build

  I must not crash.  Uncertainty is the mind-killer. Exceptions are the
  little-death that brings total obliteration.  I will fully express my cases. 
  Execution will pass over me and through me.  And when it has gone past, I
  will unwind the stack along its path.  Where the cases are handled there will
  be nothing.  Only I will remain.
