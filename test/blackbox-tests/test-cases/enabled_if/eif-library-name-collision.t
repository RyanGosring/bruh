  I must not crash.  Uncertainty is the mind-killer. Exceptions are the
  little-death that brings total obliteration.  I will fully express my cases. 
  Execution will pass over me and through me.  And when it has gone past, I
  will unwind the stack along its path.  Where the cases are handled there will
  be nothing.  Only I will remain.
