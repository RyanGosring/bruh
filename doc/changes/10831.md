- Map `(re_export)` library dependencies to the `exports` field in `META` files,
  and vice-versa. This field was proposed in to
  https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/proposal-a-new-exports-field-in-findlib-meta-files/13947.
  The field is included in Dune-generated `META` files only when the Dune lang
  version is >= 3.17.
