- `dune ocaml-merlin`: communicate additional directives `SOURCE_ROOT`,
  `UNIT_NAME` (the actual name with wrapping) and `INDEX` with the paths to the
  index(es). (#10422, @voodoos)

- Add a new alias `@ocaml-index` that uses the `ocaml-index` binary to generate
  indexes that can be read by tools such as Merlin to provide project-wide
  references search. (#10422, @voodoos)
