Diffing and promotion
*********************

``(diff <file1> <file2>)`` is very similar to ``(run diff <file1>
<file2>)``. In particular it behaves in the same way:

- when ``<file1>`` and ``<file2>`` are equal, it doesn't nothing
- when they are not, the differences are shown and the action fails

However, it is different for the following reason:

- the exact command used to diff files can be configured via the
  ``--diff-command`` command line argument. Note that it is only
  called when the files are not byte equals

- by default, it will use ``patdiff`` if it is installed. ``patdiff``
  is a better diffing program. You can install it via opam with:

  .. code:: sh

     $ opam install patdiff

- on Windows, both ``(diff a b)`` and ``(diff? a b)`` normalize the end of
  lines before comparing the files

- since ``(diff a b)`` is a builtin action, dune knowns that ``a``
  and ``b`` are needed and so you don't need to specify them
  explicitly as dependencies

- you can use ``(diff? a b)`` after a command that might or might not
  produce ``b``. For cases where commands optionally produce a
  *corrected* file

- it allows promotion. See below

Note that ``(cmp a b)`` does no end of lines normalization and doesn't
print a diff when the files differ. ``cmp`` is meant to be used with
binary files.

Promotion
~~~~~~~~~

Whenever an action ``(diff <file1> <file2>)`` or ``(diff?  <file1>
<file2>)`` fails because the two files are different, dune allows
you to promote ``<file2>`` as ``<file1>`` if ``<file1>`` is a source
file and ``<file2>`` is a generated file.

More precisely, let's consider the following dune file:

.. code:: scheme

   (rule
    (with-stdout-to data.out (run ./test.exe)))

   (alias
    (name   runtest)
    (action (diff data.expected data.out)))

Where ``data.expected`` is a file committed in the source
repository. You can use the following workflow to update your test:

- update the code of your test
- run ``dune runtest``. The diff action will fail and a diff will
  be printed
- check the diff to make sure it is what you expect
- run ``dune promote``. This will copy the generated ``data.out``
  file to ``data.expected`` directly in the source tree

You can also use ``dune runtest --auto-promote`` which will
automatically do the promotion.
